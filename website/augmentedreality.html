Augmented Reality has many uses across a wide array of fields. While the most prominent example would be in the gaming industry, many other sectors are capitalizing on the functionality of Augmented reality technology. 
Augmented Reality the usage of technology to make digital images appear on or in front of the user that do not physically exist. It is not fully immersive, and users of augmented reality devices are still able to see things physically present before them, and is such different from virtual reality devices such as Oculus Rift or PlayStation VR.
The San Francisco gaming company Niantic took augmented reality global in Summer 2016 following the release of the international sensation Pokémon Go. But even before this, Niantic had blazed the trail for augmented reality games. Ingress, released in 2012, puts a science fiction landscape that one can see on their phone, and the game is progressed by travelling around to capture portals placed throughout the countryside. Pokémon Go is similar allowing players to walk around and catch small monsters only visible on their phones. The success of Pokémon Go has spurred on development of games, even though there is an overall decline in the popularity of the game. Many in the gaming community have started to look forward to other games utilizing augmented reality, such the speculated first-person shooter made by Magic Leap, a Florida based startup. Sony has taken a different approach to augmented reality. Instead of coming out with a whole new system, they are using things to connect to the PlayStation 4, which is already owned by millions. HoloLens, by Microsoft, also allows for gaming, with a small scale first-person shooter, a platform game, and others. 
HoloLens, like the intended projects at Magic Leap, intend for more than just gaming. HoloLens is a headset-like gadget that is entirely self-contained. All of the processing power is contained inside of the gadget, and it can be used for all kinds of things, not just gaming. Among functionality released in interviews and demos are the ability to surf the web, skype, and other online interactions. HoloLens also comes with a mixed-reality app creator built in, for increased compatibility and utility. 
Other companies are looking not a commercial usage for augmented reality headgear. Touch Surgery, a U.K. based firm, is looking to use augmented reality headgear to help train medical practitioners in surgery. They have and are currently working on programs that teach students how to conduct surgeries by creating a digital patient, and then having the wearer control the surgery, by picking up digital tools, and interacting with the patient. Other places are looking into similar designs. 

However, there are some concerns. While the promises of a radically better world routinely arise from the pioneers creating augmented reality technology, there are many who have reservations about mass adoption of augmented reality technology. Chief among these fears are that augmented reality technology will breach privacy and allow hackers information not normally accessible, and that society would be negatively transformed by AR devices. 
The chief concern about augmented reality is that user distraction, intentional or otherwise, could cause problems. One example of this would be in the area of surgery, where AR could be used to help guide surgeons in complicated operations. This example is relevant in two ways, on one hand if someone would Skype, call, or email the surgeon while connected, they could easily be distracted. The other hand is far more sinister in origin, as since AR devices require internet connection, that would mean that it would be possible for them to be hacked. And while the intentional misguiding of a surgery through messing with the perceptions of a doctor sounds like a plot from a spy thriller, the possibility of hacking has many worried in the intelligence sector. 
Another concern with regard to the previous is the possibility of apps that show unwanted information. A smartphone app called “Girls Around Me” was created to show users girls physical locations after determine that they were looking for a date, regardless of whether they wanted to begin a relationship or not. The fear of many is that similar items on AR devices would allow information not wanted to be made public through AR devices.
